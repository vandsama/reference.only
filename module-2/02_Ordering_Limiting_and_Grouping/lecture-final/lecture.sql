-- Miscelleneous

-- While you can use LIMIT to limit the number of results returned by a query,
-- it's recommended to use OFFSET and FETCH if you want to get
-- "pages" of results.
-- For instance, to get the first 10 rows in the city table
-- ordered by the name, you could use the following query.
-- (Skip 0 rows, and return only the first 10 rows from the sorted result set.)
SELECT * 
FROM city
OFFSET 20 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;

SELECT * 
FROM city
OFFSET 20 ROWS
LIMIT 10;

-- SUBQUERIES (optional)

-- single row, single value
SELECT (SELECT MAX(area) FROM state) * 2 AS double_max_area;

-- multiple rows, single value
SELECT * 
FROM city 
WHERE city_id IN (SELECT capital FROM state);

-- correlated query
SELECT state_name,
	(SELECT city_name FROM city WHERE city_id = state.capital) AS capital_name -- runs once for each row in the outer query
FROM state
ORDER BY state_name;

-- subquery as table
-- The 20 oldest parks from oldest to youngest in years, sorted alphabetically by name.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT park_name, date_established
	FROM park
	ORDER BY date_established ASC
	LIMIT 20) AS oldestParks
ORDER BY park_name;


SELECT area, ROUND(area) as rounded
FROM park;



-- Include state name rather than the state abbreviation while counting the number of cities in each state,


-- Include the names of the smallest and largest parks


-- List the capital cities for the states in the Northeast census region.
